# Waikato Women in STEM (WWiSTEM) Website

A multi-page website built for **Waikato Women in STEM**, a student-led community at the University of Waikato dedicated to supporting and empowering women pursuing studies in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics.

This project was developed as **Part C — Functional Website** of the DSIGN241 Assignment 3 brief, implementing the team's Figma prototype (Part B) into a working, mobile-responsive site.

## Project Overview

The site serves four key audiences: external sponsors, current members, prospective members, and university staff/stakeholders. It provides information about the club, a sponsor showcase with tiered display (Gold, Silver, Close to Home), an events calendar with registration, a photo gallery, and membership/contact forms.

## Pages

- `index.html` — Home page, hero section, photo carousel, Cover Star feature, and membership application form
- `pages/about.html` — About Us, club description, and Contact Us section/form
- `pages/events.html` — Upcoming events with details and registration information
- `pages/gallery.html` — Photo gallery with interactive carousel and About the Gallery section
- `pages/sponsors.html` — Sponsor showcase (Gold/Silver/Close to Home tiers) and sponsor enquiry form

## Tech Stack

- **HTML5**
- **Tailwind CSS** (via CDN, with custom configuration in `scripts/tailwindConfig.js`)
- **Vanilla JavaScript** — modular scripts for navigation, carousels, and interactivity
- Custom brand colours: `deep-purple`, `middle-purple`, `pale-pink`, `dim-white`, `rich-black`
- Custom fonts: Montserrat (headings), Inter (body), Allura (script/drop-caps)
